# Projects-with-Scraping

# This repository features web-scaping using various libraries and tools available with python3

## Technologies used in making this repository:

1. Web Parsing using **Requests** Python Library (Use command **pip3 install requests** to download the library)

2. Web Scraping using **Beautiful Soup** (Use command **pip3 install bs4** to download the library)

3. String Matching using **Regular Expressions** (a.k.a regex)

4. Python data visualization using **Matplotlib** Python Library (Use command **pip3 install matplotlib** to download the library)

## Information about files in the repository:

1. **User-rating-comparator-cc.py**   : Compares the **current rating** among a given number of users on the online coding platform [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/node)

2. **problem-solved-bar-graph-cf.py**   : Takes a username on the online coding platform [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com) as input and provides a **bar graph** of Rating vs Number of problems attempted. Now as a fun activity you can try and plot the graph vs problems **Accepted**, **TLE** etc. by tweaking and adding in chips of data.
